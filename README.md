# Holberton

This repository contains all the projects I completed during my professional retraining at Holberton School in Lille, France.

## Details

Each directory represents a project I created during this training. Each of these directories covers a different topic (low-level programming, high-level programming, Docker, etc.). These are mainly exercises, not full-fledged projects.

Therefore, these projects are not the most representative of my skills. I invite you to check out the featured projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/OursBlanc42) instead.

## School
