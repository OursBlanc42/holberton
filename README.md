# Holberton
This repository contains all the sub-repositories created during my professional retraining at Holberton School in Lille, France.

## Detail
Each directory is one of the repositories I created during this professional retraining. Each of these directories covers a different topic (low-level programming, high-level programming, Docker, etc.).

These are mainly exercises, not full-fledged projects. Although the trainers advised us to be careful with our commits and branches, I wasn't always very vigilant with these exercise repositories (especially when pushing multiple times during debugging sessions and the online checker kept showing an error). Therefore, these projects are not the most representative of my skills. I invite you to check out the featured projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/OursBlanc42) instead.
